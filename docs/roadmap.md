**Note:** There are many more minor things to do as well as technical changes and improvements and things I want to try out. These don't make the list.

**Another note:** The app is free to all users and will remain free. It is developed by a single person (me) in their free time. This means that the above table is a declaration of intent and there are no guarantees.
