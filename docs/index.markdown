## Features

The "S.E.A.F. Democratic Companion" is part of every Helldiver's arsenal and makes spreading managed democracy a bit more ...manageable. Helldivers use the app to track the goal and status of the current Major Order and all active campaigns (liberations and defenses). Moreover, they closely follow Super Earth communications.

ðŸ¤”

Admittedly, the app is still rather slim on features but more are planned. See the [roadmap]({% link roadmap.md %}) for details.

If you need a more complete set of features _right now_, please consider the excellent DiversHub or War Monitor apps. I'd be happy if you used my app alongside theirs while I'm busy catching up. I use them both regularly.

## Support

This is the support page of the app and as such should provide support. If you have trouble with the app or notice bugs, please consider [creating a GitHub issue here](https://github.com/raginmari/helldivers-companion-support).
