My name is Reimar Twelker ([raginmari](https://github.com/raginmari) on GitHub) and I'm a professional mobile app developer with a background in iOS and more recently .NET MAUI (formerly Xamarin.Forms). I live in Germany and (obviously) am a big fan of the Helldivers 2 videogame. I play the game on Playstation.

If you have feedback to the app or would like to get in touch for other reasons, please send an email to {% include email.html %}.

If you have trouble with the app or discover bugs, please visit [the support GitHub](https://github.com/raginmari/helldivers-companion-support) and create an issue.
