### Support

If you have trouble with the app on your device, if you have encountered bugs or maybe have an idea for a new feature (my time is limited, but please go ahead), please consider creating an issue. Before you do so, please check the open (and possibly the recently closed) issues. Try not to create duplicates but rather take part in discussions on existing issues.

If you create a new issue, please be as specific about the matter as possible. For example, always mention the OS you are using (iOS or Android), the OS version and the device running the app. If possible, provide screenshots or even videos demonstrating the issue. In order to fix an issue, I must be able to reproduce them. Without reproduction, I'll have a hard time verifying that an issue is fixed. So, please list the steps I need to take to reproduce the issue.
